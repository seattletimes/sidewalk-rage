question
I swear to myself a lot more in crowded places than I do elsewhere.
I normally have critical thoughts about other pedestrians.
"When a shopper in a cashier line tries to steal ahead, I get furious in my mind."
"I sometimes enjoy the fantasy of doing violence to some pedestrians (e.g., imagining blowing them up or sweeping them aside). But it's just fantasy."
"When pedestrians are being inconsiderate and inconvenience other walkers, I get furious with them, even aggressive sometimes."
It's good to get your anger out because we all have aggressive feelings inside that naturally come out under stressful situations.
"When I'm very upset about something, it's often a relief to walk aggressively through a group of people to give my feelings an outlet."
I feel that it's important to remind certain obnoxious walkers to behave appropriately in crowded places instead of just letting them walk in whatever way they want.
Pedestrians shouldn't have the right to walk slowly in crosswalks when cars are waiting.
Pushy walkers really annoy me so I bad-mouth them when I can to feel better.
I tailgate when someone walks too slow for conditions.
"I try to get to my destination in the shortest time possible, or else it doesn't feel right."
If I stopped walking aggressively others would take advantage of my passivity.
I feel envious emotions when another pedestrian makes the light on time and I'm stuck on red.
I feel energized by the sense of power and competition I experience while walking aggressively through a crowded area.
I hate narrow hallways and walkways that are always crowded.
"Once in a while I get so frustrated with other pedestrians that I begin to walk recklessly, taking chances in bumping into them."
I hate dawdling shoppers and I refuse to walk differently around them.
"Sometimes I feel that I'm holding up walkers behind me so I start pressuring the pedestrians in front of me (called ""tailgating"" in driving)."
"I would feel embarrassed and frustrated to ""get stuck"" behind a crowd of slow moving pedestrians."
